# Morabaraba-
Morabaraba is a traditional open-source board game initiated from South Africa. Like most games, this one has various modes. Most importantly, we have the Clubhouse mode (whereby burnt cigarette sponges and alcohol bottle caps are used like chess pieces, the freshest player in the game gets pieces of broken bottles) and the Street or Balcony mode (Uses tiny concrete stones and plastic bottle pops). We need to get this game up and running and therefore our coding knowledge is deceiving us. Thus, we have opened access to the Public in the hope for the involvement of the exceptional GitHub community.

From the initial code, i am adding that the board image from the files titled <board_01.png> is a graphical representation of the in-game layout.
